##  ðŸ’Œ About Me
Hello!~ I am a graphic and motion designer pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Visual Communication Design at Eastern Washington University. In addition, I am currently working toward a Certificate in Front-end Web Design, where I am gaining skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My specialties include logo design, layout design, storytelling motion graphics, and kinetic typography. I am passionate about crafting compelling visual narratives that combine clean aesthetics with engaging motion design to create memorable brand experiences.
Oh, and I love saying the word "ravioli."
